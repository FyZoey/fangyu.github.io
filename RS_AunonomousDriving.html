                        <li>L4 Scenarios still need certain degree of human override, but there is a lack of research on the right of human override in L4 scenarios.</li>

                    <p class="text-left">To recall their driving experiences, all participants went through a stimulated driving experiment, in which people manually drove the car in the HMI lab as they would normally drive, experiencing the embedded typical driving scenarios.</p>

The influencing factors were then categorized according to 1) scenarios and 2) power of influencing human driving according to a KANO model:</p>

                    <p class="text-left">Voice interaction instead of paying attention to the mirrors all the time: When there's a small car passing by the truck, the internet of vehicles identify the intention of passing and prompt what is going on. So here are two ways of noticing passing cars for truck drivers, knowing that can increase car drivers more confident about safety.<br></p><img src="assets/img/Baidu_Truck.gif" style="width: 100%;">

                    <p class="text-left">Take your time off to interact with the road: Since L4 autonomous driving allows people more time to paying attention off the road, it is an opportunity to create and view information based on location. More information, more confident about driving.<br></p><img src="assets/img/Baidu_POI.gif" style="width: 100%;">

                    <p class="text-left">Like watching a game: Although drivers won't have to control the vehicle, it is still important to know what is going on. The AR on windshield can tell detailed information to make drivers feel confident.<br></p><img src="assets/img/Baidu_takingover3.png" style="width: 100%;">

I can choose one evaluation method depends on time limitation instead of taking another user evaluation after already having an expert review.</li>
                        <li><span>The perspective of thinking:</span>&nbsp;this study was proceeded with an assumption: the L4 autonomous vehicle driver's override is the same as that with driving daily regular cars. As I give a doubt on that, I would personally dig in to find out if this is true.</li>
                        <li><span>Refine the workshop:</span>&nbsp;there should be a framework for discussions and evaluations.</li>
                        <li><span>Communication through out functional teams:</span>&nbsp;I personally think the biggest contribution from the researchers are the "reasonings" of the influencing factors, but this is a black box for design teams, I prefer something like journey map that enables more discussions with design teams.</li>
